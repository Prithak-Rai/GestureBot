# GestureBot
GestureBot is a project that uses computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control servo motors. USing OpenCV, MediaPipe, and an Arduino, this system interprets hand movements and translates them into precise servo motor actions. It showcases the seamless integration of software and hardware to create gesture-based control systems.
